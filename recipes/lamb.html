<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The orzo is always high in demand in our house. A second pound wouldn't go amiss if you've a big enough pan for it. Of course, also double the feta and water, then.</p>
<p>As with all roasting recipes, you can use a lower temperature and cook longer. Three hours is the minimum I've used. You could also use 6 to 10 hours at 300 degrees F for a very tender result.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 (6 pound) bone-in leg of lamb</li>
  <li>3 cups mashed tomatoes</li>
  <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
  <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 165°C.</li>
  <li>Place lamb in a roasting pan. Add mashed tomatoes, onion, olive oil, oregano, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. Combine and make sure lamb is well coated. Cover pan with a lid or aluminum foil.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 3 hours. Remove from the oven and remove aluminum foil; leave oven on.</li>
  <li>Add water and orzo directly to the roasting pan. Return to the hot oven and bake until pasta is cooked and very little liquid remains, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Add feta cheese and mix until melted and combined.</li>
